# Albion

A simple command line argument parsing library utilizing the declarative style of programming. Inspired by Rust's clap.

**WARNING:** this library has only just started development, nothing is ready yet.

This library is published on the terms of The Unlicense, which means it is public domain. You are free to do whatever you want with it! Have fun!

A getting started guide + library capabilities overview are coming in the future, once the API is at least somewhat defined.

This library will only use cross-platform modern C++ (C++14/C++17), therefore if you have a compiler that supports C++17 (the OS doesn't matter), it should work for you.
